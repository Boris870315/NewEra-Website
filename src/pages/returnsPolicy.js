        <p>NEWERA anticipate that your purchase will meet your expectations of quality, function and design. If, however, in the unfortunate situation where you may require an exchange, you must present proof of purchase to the store.<br/><br/>You can choose an exchange or refund if the item you purchased has a major problem, such as, if the item:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Has a problem that would have stopped someone from buying the item, if they had known about it;</li>
            <li>Is unsafe;</li>
            <li>Is significantly different from the sample or description;</li>
            <li>Doesn't do what we said it would, or what you asked for and can't be easily fixed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We may offer to repair, exchange or provide a gift card If the problem is not major. If it is not repaired in a reasonable time, you can choose a refund or replacement item.<br/><br/>We are not obliged to provide an exchange or refund, if you simply change your mind about your purchase.</p>
